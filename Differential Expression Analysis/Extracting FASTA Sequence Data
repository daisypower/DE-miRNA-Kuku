## How to turn your gtf file into a list of sequences of the specific regions for each miRNA/non coding RNA you have found

##gffread can be accessed at:
/Volumes/archive/kennylab/LocalProgrammes/gffread/gffread

##To extract the sequences of all the regions in your gtf file, you can run:
/Volumes/archive/kennylab/LocalProgrammes/gffread/gffread -w OutputTranscriptsALL.fa -g /Volumes/archive/kennylab/Kuku_seq/FinalAssembly.fasta kuku.merged.gtf

##This will export ALL sequences to single multifasta file "OutputTranscriptsALL.fa" 
##Using the genome sequence file "FinalAssembly.fasta" 
##and .gtf file with  the locations that transcripts start and stop (but not their actual sequence) "kuku.merged.gtf"

##get the subset of DE sequences 

##put all the DE sequences (without a > at the start) into a text file 
##mine is called "SeqNames.txt"

## Extract using faSomeRecords (OutputTranscriptsDE.fa is the output file)
/Volumes/archive/kennylab/LocalProgrammes/faSomeRecords OutputTranscriptsALL.fa SeqNames.1.txt OutputTranscriptsDE.fa
